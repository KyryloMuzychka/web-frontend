# Exercise 1

This lab exercise is focused on building a simple interactive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The task involves creating a light switch interface that can toggle a lightbulb on and off.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: The interface consists of a switch component and a lightbulb icon. The switch toggles between "On" and "Off" states.
- **CSS**: The styles control the appearance of the switch and the lightbulb. The lightbulb changes color when switched on or off.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for toggling the lightbulb on and off when the switch is clicked.

### Files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
- `style/style.css`: Contains the styles for the switch and lightbulb.
- `script/script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic to toggle the lightbulb.

### How It Works:

1. The light switch is represented as a checkbox input wrapped in a label with two spans for the "On" and "Off" states.
2. When the checkbox is toggled, the lightbulb's class is updated, which in turn triggers a CSS style change, simulating the light turning on or off.

### How to Run:

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the interactive switch in action.

Enjoy experimenting with this simple web application!
